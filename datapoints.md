# Thoughts on listing:

## Time based\_

1. Time spent looking at an image
2. Time user spent waiting for an image to load before leaving

^ Not sure which is the best approach to list headings and groupings; I will almost certianly end up providing some kind of user searchable / sortable list in time. For this static document however, I think the second option would be best, given that a developer will always know what resources they have at their disposal (such as "I want to gather data on this image"), but might not alway be sure what data specifically they want to gather in advanced ("I want to gather the length of time users have looked at these images"). The list will be appended on an 'as created' basis.
