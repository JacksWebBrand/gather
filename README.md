# ðŸš€gather

## what\_

**_API's for harvesting every conceivable datapoint; visually represented in a typical social media app._**

## how\_

Microservices provide the most opportunities for data handling and recording. Therefore, **gather** will be a microservices based social media application with two distinct layers. The first will be the surface application; the second will be an overlay which illustrates the data being gathered in real-time.

## why\_

Belief and necessity. Initially I had the desire to implement models on datapoints to provide answers to the typical 'data' questions: user attraction / retention etc, but there simply weren't enough datapoints available online. Nor was there any consistency across the data that was available making it very difficult to make anything particularly useful with.

## goal\_

To learn. Crucially (at least for now), I want to handcraft each API. Each one should be extremely simple, scalable and powerful. The point is not to tell anyone how to use the data gathered (although examples will naturally be given), but to provide the tools to consistently gather everything possible. Nobody knows just what we will be able to do with the data in the future, so even if it seams useless today we can just keep it on simmer untill it becomes obvious what we should be doing with it!

## tech\_

Currently, the plan is to implement the main application with React / Typescript; the 'microservices' that will power it with Typescript; the databases with mongoDB; and, most importantly, the API's in Typescript. Should this prove impractical however, as I learn I am open to change for the good of the data! The point is the API's - not the quality of the app they will each be demonstrated within.
